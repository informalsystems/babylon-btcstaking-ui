        interface (the &quot;App&quot;) that displays data that facilitates
        users interfacing with a set of decentralized open-sourced smart
        contracts that allow for the restaking of digital assets, such as
        Bitcoin (BTC). The Services may also reference or provide an App or APIs
        related to smart contracts that provide a data availability service. The
        third party technologies required to be used with or in order to
        interact with relevant smart contracts, or with a Wallet (as defined
        below, and collectively the “Third-Party Tools”), are not part of the
        Services, and your use of such Third-Party Tools are entirely at your
        own risk. The App is separate and distinct from any Third-Party Tools.
        <br></br>
        a.) Wallets. To use certain of the Services you may need to link a
        third-party digital wallet (&quot;Wallet&quot;) with the Services. By
        using a Wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that you are
        using the Wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable
        third-party provider of such Wallet. Wallets are not associated with,
        maintained by, supported by or affiliated with the Company. You
        acknowledge and agree that we are not party to any transactions
        conducted while accessing our App, and we do not have possession,
        custody or control over any digital assets appearing on the Services.
        When you interact with the App, you retain control over your digital
        assets at all times. The Company accepts no responsibility or liability
        to you in connection with your use of a Wallet, and makes no
        representations and warranties regarding how the Services will operate
        with any specific Wallet. The private keys and/or seed phrases necessary
        to access the assets held in a Wallet are not held by the Company. The
        Company has no ability to help you access or recover your private keys
        and/or seed phrases for your Wallet.
        <br></br>b.) Updates; Monitoring. We may make any improvement,
        modifications or updates to the Services, including but not limited to
        changes and updates to the underlying software, infrastructure, security
        protocols, technical configurations or service features (the
        &quot;Updates&quot;) from time to time. Your continued access and use of
        the Services are subject to such Updates and you shall accept any
        patches, system upgrades, bug fixes, feature modifications, or other
        maintenance work that arise out of such Updates. We are not liable for
        any failure by you to accept and use such Updates in the manner
        specified or required by us. Although the Company is not obligated to
        monitor access to or participation in the Services, it has the right to
        do so for the purpose of operating the Services, to ensure compliance
        with the Terms and to comply with applicable law or other legal

        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
        INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION OR

        <br></br>Assumption of Risks. By using the Services, you represent that
        you have sufficient knowledge and experience in business and financial
        matters, including a sufficient understanding of blockchain or
        cryptographic tokens and technologies and other digital assets, storage
        mechanisms (such as Wallets), blockchain-based software systems, and
        blockchain technology, to be able to assess and evaluate the risks and
        benefits of the Services contemplated hereunder, and will bear the risks
        thereof, including loss of all amounts, and the risk that any relevant
        tokens may have little or no value. You acknowledge and agree that there
        are risks associated with holding cryptocurrency, using blockchain
        technology and staking cryptocurrency. These include, but are not
        limited to, risk of losing access to cryptocurrency due to slashing,
        loss of private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, risk of
        mining or blockchain attacks, risk of hacking and security weaknesses,
        risk of unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more
        jurisdictions, risk related to token taxation, risk of personal
        information disclosure, risk of uninsured losses, volatility risks, and
        unanticipated risks. You acknowledge that cryptocurrencies are not (i)
        deposits of or guaranteed by a bank (ii) insured by the FDIC or by any
        other governmental agency and (iii) that we do not custody and cannot
        transfer any cryptocurrency or digital assets you may interact with
        relative to the Services. The regulatory regime governing blockchain
        technologies, cryptocurrencies and other digital assets is highly
        uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely
        affect the potential utility or value of such cryptocurrencies and
        digital assets. There also exists the risks of new taxation relating to
        the disposition of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. We cannot
        control how third-party exchange platforms quote or value
        cryptocurrencies and other digital assets and we expressly deny and
        disclaim any liability to you and deny any obligations to indemnify or
        hold you harmless for any losses you may incur as a result of
        fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies or other digital assets.
        Smart contracts execute automatically when certain conditions are met.
        Since smart contracts typically cannot be stopped or reversed,
        vulnerabilities in their programming and design or other vulnerabilities
        that may arise due to hacking or other security incidents can have
        adverse effects to restaked assets, including but not limited to
        significant volatility and risk of loss. Certain protocols and networks
        subject staked assets to slashing upon certain conditions, including,
        but not limited to, if a validator or operator engages in harmful or
        malicious behavior, fails to perform their role as a validator or
        operator properly, or incorrectly validates a transaction, and we
        expressly deny and disclaim any liability to you and deny any
        obligations to indemnify or hold you harmless for any losses you may
        incur as a result of slashing. Certain protocols and networks require
        that a certain amount of staked assets be locked for a certain period of
        time while staking, and withdrawal of staked assets may be delayed. We
        do not guarantee the security or functionality of any third-party
        protocol, software or technology intended to be compatible with restaked
        assets. The tax consequences of purchasing, selling, holding,
        transferring, or locking tokens or otherwise utilizing the Protocol are
        uncertain and may vary by jurisdiction. Company has no responsibility
        whatsoever for tax related implications of your use of the Services and
        you assume all risk of liability or loss relating to any tax issues.
        Tokens staked through a hardware wallet will not have the ability to
        unbond. You are strongly discouraged from using a hardware wallet for
        the Services.
        <br></br>Indemnification. By entering into these Terms and accessing or
        using the Services, you agree that you shall defend, indemnify and hold
        the Company harmless from and against any and all claims, costs,
        damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys&apos fees
        and costs) incurred by the Company arising out of or in connection with:
        (a) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any
        applicable law or regulation; (b) your violation of any rights of any
        third party; (c) your misuse of the Services; or (d) your negligence or
        wilful misconduct; or (e) your Content. If you are obligated to
        indemnify the Company hereunder, then you agree that the Company will
        have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or
        proceeding and to determine whether the Company wishes to settle, and if
        so, on what terms, and you agree to fully cooperate with the Company in
        the defense or settlement of such claim.
